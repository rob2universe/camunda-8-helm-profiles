# Camunda 8 Helm Profile: Azure App Gateway Ingress with TLS

> **Note**  this profile uses an Azure App Gateway which [doesn't support GRPC traffic](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/blog/application-gateway-ingress-controller-for-azure-kubernetes-service/). You probably want to use [the nginx ingress profile](../nginx/tls) instead.

> **Note**  This profile is still a work in progress. For latest progress, please see this [Github Issue](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-helm-profiles/issues/37)
